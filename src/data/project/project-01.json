        "The Loanfund tool is a tool built for lenders to help manage the whole loan and grant process, the CRM, application, review and acceptance. It was mainly focused toward community development institutions and imapact in the communities economic development."
    ],
    "concept": [
        "The tool was conceptualized throught the parent product. The Opportunity exchange was primarily an opportunity zone marketplace that sought to connect community developers to community development institutions (CDFI) and then to investors. Through our customers we gained insight into some of the problems that plague CDFIs. One being the inefficiencies of their load and grant processes. The Loanfund tool was born to cut out the lag of switching between many services, a place where all loan processes can be in a singular location.",
        "We outlined a web app with applicant and grantor views. CDFIs were able to have regular conversations with applicant and also track and control every stage of the application process ending in acceptance or rejection. The initial app lacked some omplexity and metrics tracking need to run loan application. We tested a interations with our users and through regular feedback we were able to put together a one stop shop for applicants and lenders.",
        "in 6 months we put together a beta product while also developing and maintaining two other revenue generating products at The Opportunity Exchange. We onboarded a 3 major CDFIs plus a couple smaller ones and went through the 5 loan/grant events in the first 2 months."
    ],
    "role": [
        "As a sole Software Engineer in a 5 person startup, I had the opportunity to work on all aspects related to the product. I converted user interviews to features, planned out the development timelines for features, was heavily involved in determining what the sprint process was and developed the features."

    "key_takeaways": [
        "5 grant events done through the tool by the major CDFI",
        "The development of the loanfund tool coupled with the customer insights gained from the project created a path to product market fit for the company.",
        "Served our customers more broadly with a scalable solution allowing us to pivot away from opportunity zones",
        "Increased revenues by 20%",
        "I lead a lot of development cycles, gaining experience in writing and setting requirements within the time frame of the stakeholder"
