        "Aussies were developed on ranches in the western United States, and were seen as early as the 1800s. These pups are very focused, and need lots of attention, pawsitive reinforcement, and exercise. They can still be found working on the ranch, but also work as guide dogs, therapy dogs, drug detectors, and of course, manâ€™s best friend. People often seek them out for their incredibly strong hunting abilities. They are excellent swimmers, too, so a nice lake or pool is A-OK! However, they do require regular exercise and would fit best with an active family."

    "concept": [
        "The tool was conceptualized throught the parent product. The Opportunity exchange was primarily an opportunity zone marketplace that sought to connect community developers to community development institutions (CDFI) and then to investors. Through our customers we gained insight into some of the problems that plague CDFIs. One being the inefficiencies of their load and grant processes. The Loanfund tool was born to cut out the lag of switching between many services, a place where all loan processes can be in a singular location.",
        "We outlined a web app with applicant and grantor views. CDFIs were able to have regular conversations with applicant and also track and control every stage of the application process ending in acceptance or rejection. The initial app lacked some omplexity and metrics tracking need to run loan application. We tested a interations with our users and through regular feedback we were able to put together a one stop shop for applicants and lenders.",
        "in 6 months we put together a beta product while also developing and maintaining two other revenue generating products at The Opportunity Exchange. We onboarded a 3 major CDFIs plus a couple smaller ones and went through the 5 loan/grant events in the first 2 months."

        "As a sole Software Engineer in a 5 person startup, I had the opportunity to work on all aspects related to the product. I converted user interviews to features, planned out the development timelines for features, was heavily involved in determining what the sprint process was and developed the features."
